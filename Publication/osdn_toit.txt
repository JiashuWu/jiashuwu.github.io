abstract = {As Internet of Things devices become widely used in the real-world, it is crucial to protect them from malicious intrusions. However, the data scarcity of IoT limits the applicability of traditional intrusion detection methods, which are highly data-dependent. To address this, in this article, we propose the Open-Set Dandelion Network (OSDN) based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation in an open-set manner. The OSDN model performs intrusion knowledge transfer from the knowledge-rich source network intrusion domain to facilitate more accurate intrusion detection for the data-scarce target IoT intrusion domain. Under the open-set setting, it can also detect newly-emerged target domain intrusions that are not observed in the source domain. To achieve this, the OSDN model forms the source domain into a dandelion-like feature space in which each intrusion category is compactly grouped and different intrusion categories are separated, i.e., simultaneously emphasising inter-category separability and intra-category compactness. The dandelion-based target membership mechanism then forms the target dandelion. Then, the dandelion angular separation mechanism achieves better inter-category separability, and the dandelion embedding alignment mechanism further aligns both dandelions in a finer manner. To promote intra-category compactness, the discriminating sampled dandelion mechanism is used. Assisted by the intrusion classifier trained using both known and generated unknown intrusion knowledge, a semantic dandelion correction mechanism emphasises easily-confused categories and guides better inter-category separability. Holistically, these mechanisms form the OSDN model that effectively performs intrusion knowledge transfer to benefit IoT intrusion detection. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion datasets verify the effectiveness of the OSDN model, outperforming three state-of-the-art baseline methods by 16.9\%. The contribution of each OSDN constituting component, the stability and the efficiency of the OSDN model are also verified.},

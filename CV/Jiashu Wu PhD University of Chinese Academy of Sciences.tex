\begin{itemize}
  \setlength\itemsep{2.0pt}
  \item Design and implement an online cost-driven data caching algorithm in the distributed cloud environment. Challenges including cost optimisation under online settings. Solved via packable anticipatory caching model construction. The algorithm is feasible for big data applications due to its optimised cost and excellent scalability. 
  \item The algorithm reduces data caching cost by 5\%-11\%. Theoretically, the competitive ratio and its lower bound for the online algorithm are proved. 
  \item \textbf{Skills \& Outcomes}: big data caching optimisation, theoretical analysis, data mining and analytics, Python programming. Published 2 CCF-A papers and 3 patents.
